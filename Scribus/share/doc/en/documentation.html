<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>This section is the main area of the user documentation for Scribus. In this section we will outline major areas of interest from installation through getting your beautiful document ready for professional printing or the web. Read on for more, but don't hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Since this Online Help probably can't answer all of your questions, you should also read the last section of the documentation to find out how to contact the Scribus Team and other users, who are more than willing to help you succeed.</p>
