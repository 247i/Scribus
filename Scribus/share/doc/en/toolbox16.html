<h2>Fontmatrix</h2>
<p>For those coming from MacOSX or an even older MacOS version, one of the perceived missing parts on Linux is a nice graphical font manager. Enter <a href="http://fontmatrix.net">Fontmatrix</a>. While it is young, it has all the essentials to manage fonts both individually and in groups via &ldquo;tags&rdquo;. Fontmatrix also has some nice features to preview fonts via sample text, and to do so at scalable sizes, along with the ability to view individual glyphs. Even better, Fontmatrix supports OpenType fonts very well, and in the future even more Open Type features will be added.</p>

<p>While Fontmatrix does not &ldquo;activate&rdquo; fonts on the fly for already running applications, it can add and remove fonts quickly without messing with the important system fonts which all applications rely on. So for working with Scribus or other graphics applications, simply preview and add fonts as needed, then restart your application. Lastly, Fontmatrix can create "fontbooks" which are PDF files displaying each font. </p>
