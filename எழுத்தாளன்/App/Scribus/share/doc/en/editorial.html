<h2>Editorial Notes</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The Scribus Online Help is not a complete or detailed description of all the features provided by Scribus. Rather, its purpose is to provide enough information for you to use the program successfully. In addition, the authors intended to introduce those who are new to desktop publishing to concepts that are unique to this very special kind of software, as well as make users aware of traps and pitfalls lurking on the way from creating documents to professional printing.</p>
<p>This documentation will grow with each Scribus release, so the available information will become more and more complete. In addition, the Scribus Team is working on a new edition of the printed Scribus manual, which will contain even more detailed information and examples.</p>
<p>An added feature to the manual is that you can now view the English version with an outside browser. Simply direct your browser to share/doc/scribus/en/menu.xml wherever your installation has placed it. There is now an XSL file in the documentation which will interpret menu.xml as an HTML page so that you can navigate the manual.</p>
<h3>Spelling</h3>
<p>The English version of the Scribus Online Help uses (<i>cum grano salis</i>) US spelling. This was simply a pragmatic decision, since two out of three main authors are US citizens. Moreover, while most international standards bodies (most notably ISO) require the use of &ldquo;International&rdquo; (read: British) English, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that anyone will have difficulties in understanding a text written in US spelling. An exception to the rule is screenshots, which may display the British or Australian version of the user interface.</p>
<h3>Screenshots</h3>
<p>Almost all screenshots in this Online Help have been created under the Fedora or OpenSUSE versions of KDE&nbsp;4. The dialogs may look slightly different on other operating systems or under other desktop environments, but thanks to the Qt toolkit, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any differences in actual usage.</p>
<h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
<p>Unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, all keyboard shortcuts in this Online Help refer to PC keyboards (Linux, UNIX, Windows, OS/2, eComStation).</p>
<h3>Files and Directories</h3>
<p>The authors of this documentation tried and continue to try to treat all supported operating systems equally. However, due to historical reasons, sometimes only file locations on Linux/UNIX may be mentioned. If you discover one of those instances, feel free to notify the development team, so this can be fixed.</p>
