<h2>XnView</h2>
<p>There are image previewers and thumbnailing applications galore &ndash; even Konqueror and Nautilus have some of these features, so why should anyone use XnView?</p>


<p>It&rsquo;s ugly. It uses old, Motif-like libraries, but it has two very redeeming qualities: </p>
<ol><li>It&rsquo;s very fast, faster than most similar programs. </li>
<li>It handles a wide array of image formats with very good conversion capabilities. There are some real obscure file formats XnView can open and convert. It&rsquo;s probable that only ImageMagick can handle more. It&rsquo;s very stable and worth at least considering for your toolbox.</li></ol>
