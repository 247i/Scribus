<p><b>Antiword</b>, which is shipped with the Windows version of Scribus, is a separately licensed program under the GPL, and the copyright license is included with the program.</p>

<p><b>Resources</b>, like the documentation, dictionary files, color profiles, color palettes, or templates, use their own licenses that need not be compatible with any of the licenses mentioned above, because resources are considered to be content, not functional code. <br><i>Note that some of these files, especially some color palettes, are subject to very strict licensing conditions.</i></p>
